# Production-Ready Payment Gateway

A production-grade payment gateway built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, and Docker.
The platform supports asynchronous payments, refunds, idempotent APIs, payment capture,
secure webhooks with retry logic, an embeddable checkout SDK, and a minimal operational dashboard.

This implementation strictly follows the provided project specification (PDF).

---

## 🚀 Features

### Payments
- Asynchronous payment processing using **BullMQ + Redis**
- Payment lifecycle: `pending → success / failed`
- Explicit **payment capture** flow
- **Idempotent payment creation** using `Idempotency-Key`

### Refunds
- Full and partial refunds
- Asynchronous refund processing
- Refund lifecycle tracking

### Webhooks
- Secure webhooks using **HMAC SHA-256**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (test-mode schedule)
- Manual webhook retry API
- Persistent webhook delivery logs with attempts & status

### SDK & Dashboard
- **Embeddable Checkout SDK** (`checkout.js`)
- Modal + iframe-based checkout
- Communication via `postMessage`
- Minimal dashboard for webhook observability

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Redis for background job queues
- Fully containerized using **Docker Compose**

## 🔑 API Endpoints

### Create Payment
```
POST /api/v1/payments
```

Headers:
```
Idempotency-Key: <unique-key>
```

Body:
```json
{
  "order_id": "order_123",
  "method": "upi",
  "vpa": "user@paytm",
  "amount": 50000
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "pay_xxxx",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

---

### Capture Payment
```
POST /api/v1/payments/{payment_id}/capture
```

---

### Create Refund
```
POST /api/v1/refunds
```

Body:
```json
{
  "payment_id": "pay_xxxx",
  "amount": 20000,
  "reason": "Customer requested refund"
}
```

---

### List Webhook Logs
```
GET /api/v1/webhooks
```

---

### Retry Webhook
```
POST /api/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/retry
```

---

## 🔔 Webhook Security

- All webhooks are signed using **HMAC SHA-256**
- Signature sent via header:
```
X-Signature: <signature>
```
- Merchants verify payload integrity using a shared webhook secret

---

## 💳 Checkout SDK Usage

Include SDK:
```html
<script src="http://localhost:8000/sdk/checkout.js"></script>
```

Open checkout:
```html
<script>
PaymentGateway.open({
  order_id: "order_sdk_1",
  amount: 50000,
  onSuccess: (res) => {
    console.log("Payment Success:", res);
  },
  onFailure: (err) => {
    console.error("Payment Failed:", err);
  }
});
</script>
```

---

## 📊 Dashboard

Webhook dashboard available at:
```
http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```

Displays:
- Webhook events
- Delivery status
- Retry attempts

---

## 🐳 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose

### Start the application
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Health Check
```
GET http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "db": "Connected"
}
```

## 🧪 Verification Summary

- Asynchronous payment processing verified
- Idempotency verified (no duplicate payments)
- Payment capture tested
- Refunds (full & partial) tested
- Webhook delivery, failure, and retries verified
- Manual webhook retry verified
- Checkout SDK modal and callbacks verified
- Dashboard loads webhook logs correctly

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

- `node_modules/` excluded from version control
- `.env` files excluded from version control
- Dependencies installed at build time using Docker
- Secrets managed via environment variables

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **real-world payment gateway architecture** with:
- Reliability through async processing
- Security via signatures and idempotency
- Observability through logs and dashboard
- Scalability using queues and workers

Implemented fully in compliance with the given project specification.
